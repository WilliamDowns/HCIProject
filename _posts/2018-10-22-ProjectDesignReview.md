title: Project Design Review
---

Our previous design concepts differed in hardware implementation but heavily overlapped in actual UI and task implementations. We have chosen to combine different elements form our original three designs rather than refine the details of one specific design. Our chosen design features both large touch-interactive screens (one per art exhibit) and a minimal web-app accessible by mobile phone. The primary focus is on the large touch screens because of their communal aspect and enhanced visual capabilities, but minimal optional mobile functionality offers users additional convenience and privacy.


Leaving comments is one of the most important tasks in addressing our problem of museum self-consciousness. By leaving comments, users can express any of their thoughts on the art they see, thus engaging with the art around them and leaving ideas for other art amateurs to consider. Users can hover their phone’s camera over an embedded QR-code in a piece of art, directing the user to a web page where they can leave a brief comment on the art piece. This mobile commenting functionality offers privacy to the user, a key aspect for users who may be self-conscious about expressing their thoughts publicly. All comments are displayed anonymously on the wall-mounted screens. Each screen features an interface where users can rotate around a panorama of the exhibit and select specific pieces of art. From here, users can see existing comments clustered by calculated similarity, reply to existing comments, or leave a new comment. Comments can be typed or handwritten on the screen, and are limited to a certain number of characters when typed. With multiple options for leaving comments, this design lets users express their thoughts no matter their shyness. Thus this design effectively accommodates any self-consciousness users may have, directly addressing our primary problem.


Receiving validation makes users feel like they are part of a community and encourages users to both use this product more and generally engage more with art. When a user submits a comment either on a wall-mounted screen or on their phone, they are automatically shown comments that are determined to be similar by an algorithm. The user can thus see that other people share similar ideas without requiring people to directly respond to the user’s own comment. Users should still receive validation when no similar comment is found. In this scenario, an encouraging message is displayed that conveys genuine appreciation for the user’s comment. Beyond specifically related ideas, users should also be able to see comments that are at a similarly low “art intelligence”. Given the results our graffiti wall experiment, we believe that limiting comment length and encouraging users to express any ideas will yield comments that are low-level or superficial. Thus users will be able to easily find comments of low sophistication, validating amateur opinions. The interface for viewing comments on the large screen will easily allow the basic exploration needed to find these types of comments.


Overall, our new design facilitates the above tasks better than any of our original designs and directly allows us to address our main problem of museum self-consciousness.
