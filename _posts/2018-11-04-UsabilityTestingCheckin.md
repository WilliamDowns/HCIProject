# Cognitive Walkthrough Results and Revisions

The button to share an emotional response simply says “Share”, which has online / social network connotations. This violates walk-through question 3: “Will user recognize actions as the correct one?” with a severity of 2.

We have revised the share button to say “submit” instead, with an additional descriptive blurb to make it clear that the user will be brought to a screen showing how other people reacted.
