# Cognitive Walkthrough Results and Revisions

### Issue 1
The button to share an emotional response simply says “Share”, which has online / social network connotations. This violates walk-through question 3: “Will user recognize actions as the correct one?” with a severity of 2.

We have revised the share button to say “submit” instead, with an additional descriptive blurb to make it clear that the user will be brought to a screen showing how other people reacted.

### Issue 2

There is no indicator in the early stages of the phone webapp that the user will actually be able to submit their responses and see what other people felt. This violates walk-through question 3, “Will user recognize actions as the correct one?” with a severity of 2.

We have added a “?” button to the homepage of the webapp (the sensing for artwork page) that directs the user to a blurb about the basic functionality of the app. We also slightly changed the wording on the homepage to make it clear that the user should approach a piece of art.

# Usability Testing


## Incidents

### Incident 1

The user found the purpose of many different buttons in the prototype, such as the submit button and the question mark that we added in the cognitive walkthrough, to be clear.

### Incident 2

The user was told on the phone comments page to check out the large interactive display for more results, but was confused because the phone could also be considered a large-ish interactive display. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.

We added a hyperlink to the comments page that says “See more at the nearest display”. When tapped, this link takes the user to a map of the exhibit they are in with a highlighted location of the interactive display and an icon indicating the user’s current location.

### Incident 3

The user approached the large screen, and was confused about whether they were able / supposed to select a painting. We rate this issue as 1 on the severity scale.

We added a sentence “Tap an artwork to explore!” to the homepage of the large screen to make the purpose of this page more clear.

### Incident 4

The user could not tell that they were able to scroll through the visualization of paintings on the main page of the large screen. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.


We added arrows to the sides of the homepage of the large screen to indicate scrolling ability.

### Incident 5

The user was confused by the display of blank, unhighlighted people on the “Filter by Feeling” screen, and could not tell if any emotion or group of people were supposed to already be selected. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.


We decided that in the actual display, an emotion will always be highlighted and the corresponding group of people will always be highlighted. This will make it clearer to the user that they can select an emotion to filter the crowd of people by that emotion. We also wrote a blurb on the side of this page to indicate that the visualization represents all of the people who reacted to the feeling.


### Incident 6


The user was confused by the button depicting a pencil on the large screen’s reply page, which is meant to indicate the option to write a comment versus typing a comment. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.


We’ve added two larger buttons on the side of the large screen’s comment box that say “TYPE” and “WRITE” (with WRITE in more of a handwritten font). If you touch “TYPE”, a keyboard will pop up. If you touch “WRITE”, a pop-up says “Write your comment with one of the styluses located next to the screen!”
