# Problem and Solution Overview

Art museums can often inspire feelings of self-consciousness for those who feel like their opinions are not valid or who feel intimidated by the quiet, serious atmosphere that art museums often exude. As a solution, we propose a QR-code enabled web-app that allows museum-goers to share their emotional reaction to an artwork through a simple panel of faces expressing different moods. The user then receives information about the number of attendees who felt either the same emotion (if there are enough people) or the number of attendees who fell in the same category of emotions. This category of similarity is widened as necessary to ensure that each person is guaranteed a validating response. An additional wall-mounted interactive display component takes all of the user-provided data and creates a mass visualization of emotions for each artwork, represented through animations of groups of people. By interacting with the display, museum-goers can view and interact with comments that other people have left, thus building a sense of community founded on ranges of different reactions.


# Initial Paper Prototype 

After a series of exercises investigating what amateur users desired from art museums and what tasks would help them reach those desires (see [Art for Amarteurs](https://williamdowns.github.io/amarteurs/2018-10-25-UserExperienceResearchOverview/)), we developed a paper prototype of a design (as described in the overview above). Our original paper prototype contained two components: a web-based app, which we delivered using a cardboard mobile phone, and a interactive visual display, which we simulated using a large posterboard. The web-based app had a series of screens letting users emotionally react to a piece of art, see how many people responded to that piece of art, comment on a piece of art, and see “similar” comments from other people about that piece of art. On the large interactive visual display, users could select a piece of art, select an emotional response to that piece of art and see how many people responded with that emotion. Users could also see all comments from people who reacted with this emotion, and respond in text or stylus writing to any comment. Below is an overview of our initial prototype, showing both the phone and large interactive display components.

Both of these prototypes facilitated our two primary tasks. Our two primary tasks were:
* Find a piece of art and share an emotional response. Figure out how many people felt the same way as you. Here are the emotional response selection and post-submission screens:

* Leave a comment about an artwork and see how people who felt differently reacted. Here is the large display's comment feed screen:

Through these tasks users can leave their own responses, feel community by seeing responses from people who think similarly, and explore how people with other opinions feel. For more details, visit [Paper Prototype](https://williamdowns.github.io/amarteurs/2018-10-29-PaperPrototype/).
