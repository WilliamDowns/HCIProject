Below is a list of the issues identified and how we responded to them.


* The emotion icons are ambiguous, violating heuristic 2: matching between the system and the real world with a severity of 1.

We believe that the lack of the color in the smartboard paper prototype makes those emotions more ambiguous than they would be in the real design (where they would match commonly known emojis), but we agree that the "confusion" face is particularly ambiguous and have adjusted it accordingly.


* The comment-viewing screens on the app and smartboard have inconsistent interfaces, violating heuristic 4: consistency and standards with a severity of 2.

We have adjusted the smartboard interface to more closely match the phone interface.

* Emotions are seemingly randomly arranged in a line rather than as a spectrum, violating heuristic 2: matching between the system and the real world with a severity of 2.

We rearranged the line of emojis on the smartboard to be on a spectrum from angry to excited.

* Comments on the smartboard look like a conversation rather than discrete threads, violating heuristic 4: consistency and standards with a severity of 2.

The comments should not look like a conversation; we have adjusted 

* The screen on the phone that shows similar comments to user's comment does not inform the user that these comments are supposed to be similar, violating heuristic 6: recognition rather than recall with a severity of 2.

* The back buttons on the phone leave a comment and similar comments screens have unclear destinations, violating heuristic 3: user control and freedom with a severity of 2.

* The "Thanks for Sharing" page has a lot of text, violating heuristic 8: aesthetic and minimalist design with a severity of 2.

* The option to have both keyboard and writing functionality on the smartboard seems unnecessary, violating heuristic 8: aesthetic and minimalist design with a severity of 1.

* There are no back buttons on the comment thread and emotion filter screens on the smartboard, violating heuristic 3: user control and freedom with a severity of 3.



* The hues surrounding the paintings on the smartboard may be too much info for the home screen of the smartboard, violating heuristic 8: aesthetic and minimalist design with a severity of 1.
