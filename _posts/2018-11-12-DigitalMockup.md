The following is an overview of our digital mockup, created with Balsamiq. 


##Task 1: Sharing Emotions: Find a piece of art and share an emotional response. Figure out how many people felt the same way.

The user begins on their phone’s camera screen. A QR code at the front desk of the museum brings the user to the Amarteurs webpage.

The user arrives at the Amarteurs webpage where they are asked for permission to run the webapp. If they hit Decline, the prototype is over. If they hit Accept, they will be brought to the app’s idle screen.

Here is the idle screen of the webapp, waiting for the user to approach a piece of art.

The user approaches a piece of art and is prompted to select how they feel. They can tap to select an emotion from the different emojis below the piece of art.

The user has chosen their reaction emoji. They are shown a screen with the reaction they’ve chosen, with the option to go back or submit their reaction. If they go back, they return to the previous screen with the possible emotions and the photo of the piece of art. If they choose to submit, they are brought to the next screen.

The user has chosen to share their reaction emoji. They are told the number of people who felt the same way (chose similar reactions) and are shown that number of faces with the same expression as the one they chose. The user sees that other people reacted the same way they did (the numbers are slightly fudged so that some minimum number of people are always shown to have reacted similarly).

##Task 2: Commenting: Leave a comment about an artwork and see how people who felt differently reacted.

Beginning where they left off, the user can tap the “Comment” button to progress to the next screen.

This screen asks the user to type a comment. They can tap the send button to submit their comment. The comment is pre-prepared in the paper prototype.

The user has submitted their comment and is taken to a screen with comments in speech bubbles. These comments were deemed “similar” to the user’s comment, and the words that triggered the similarity algorithm are bolded. If other people had similar thoughts, the user is shown that other people had similar thoughts and is thus validated. Otherwise, the user is still shown a list of comments that are deemed closest. They are prompted to go to the large screen if they want to see more comments, and can click the button over this text to go to a map showing the location of the screen.
